# FolderCircleIllustration

The FolderCircleIllustration component creates a folder illustration using inline SVG. This illustration is commonly used within McGonnagall introduction cards.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import FolderCircleIllustration from '@unitedincome/components/dist/FolderCircleIllustration';
```

```javascript
import {FolderCircleIllustration} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <FolderCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
</Preview>

<FolderCircleIllustration height="14rem" width="14rem" />
```

You can use the `draft` prop to render the illustrations draft mode variant.

```javascript
